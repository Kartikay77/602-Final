# 📊 College Donations Dashboard

This project explores insights from the `CollegeDonations.xls` dataset using advanced data visualizations in Tableau. The goal was to uncover trends in donor behavior, donation types, and departmental contributions to support fundraising strategies.

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze donation patterns and provide actionable business intelligence through interactive dashboards.

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau Desktop** (.twbx)
- **Excel** (data preprocessing)
- **PowerPoint** (storytelling and presentation)

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Pareto Chart**: Highlighted top contributors and departments generating 80% of total donations.
- **Donut Chart**: Displayed proportional breakdown of donation types.
- **Waterfall Chart**: Illustrated year-over-year change in donation totals.
